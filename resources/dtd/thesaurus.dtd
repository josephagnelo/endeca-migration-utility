<!--
	The THESAURUS_ENTRY element indicates a set of forms (THESAURUS_FORM
	elements) that are all equivalent.  A search for any of these
	forms (including stemming-matched versions) returns hits for all
	of the forms.

<!ELEMENT THESAURUS_ENTRY (THESAURUS_FORM+)>
<!ELEMENT THESAURUS_FORM (#PCDATA)>

<!--
	THESAURUS_ENTRY_ONEWAY elements specify single-direction
	mappings. Searches for any of the "from" forms (THESAURUS_FORM_FROM
	elements) also return hits for all of the "to" forms
	(THESAURUS_FORM_TO elements). But the other direction isn't enabled
	- searches for the "to" forms do not return results for either the
	"from" forms or the other "to" forms.
