	Global run-time spelling configuration.

<!ELEMENT SPELL_CONFIG (COMMENT?, SPELL_ENGINE?)>

<!--
	The SPELL_ENGINE element specifies what spelling engine to use.
	There are two simple engines: ASPELL and ESPELL.  The other
	three choices are used to combine spelling engines.  UNION_DICTS
	combines the spelling suggestions from two or more engines.
	FIRST_DICT returns suggestions from the first engine that can
	handle a given word.  DICT_PER_LANGUAGE uses a separate dictionary
	for each language so that, for example, the user won't receive 
	English spelling suggestions for a Spanish query.

	All spell engines have a LANGUAGES attribute, which causes the 
	spelling engine to ignore words in any languages other than those
	specified.  Languages are identified by their two-letter ISO 639 
	code, e.g. "en" for English, "ja" for Japanese, etc.  Chinese has 
	two variations: "zh-CN" for simplified, "zh-TW" for traditional.
	Multiple languages should be separated by commas.

	Aspell is a phonetic spelling engine that only works for 
	English-like words (only letters A through Z, no accented letters,
	no numbers, etc).

	Espell is a non-phonetic spelling engine that works for words 
	in any language, as well as non-alphabetic words (i.e. words 
	containing numbers or punctuation).

<!--
	FIRST_DICT lets you combine two or more spelling engines, such
	that the first engine that can handle a given word will handle it,
	and subsequent spelling engines will not even know about the word.

	For example, if you have aspell as the first engine, and espell
	as the second, then words that aspell cannot handle will be
	handed to the espell engine instead.  In this configuration,
	the espell engine would not know about any words handled by
	aspell, so it would not suggest them as possible alternatives.

<!--
	UNION_DICTS lets you combine two or more spelling engines, such
	that each engine receives all words and all queries.

	For example, if you union aspell and espell, then aspell will 
	handle English-like words, while espell will handle all words.
	Because the two spell engines have different strengths, this is
	different behavior from simply letting espell handle all words.
