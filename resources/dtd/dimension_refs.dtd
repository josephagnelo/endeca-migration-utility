<!--
	The DIMENSION_REF element describes the various attributes of a
	dimension.

	TYPE				(PRIMARY | SECONDARY)	#REQUIRED

	The TYPE attribute specifies whether this dimension is a
	primary dimension or a secondary dimension.  Refer to the Endeca
	Documentation for a more detailed description.

	HIDDEN				(TRUE | FALSE)		"FALSE"

	If the HIDDEN attribute is set to TRUE, then dvals from this
	dimension will never be considered for refinement computation.

	MULTI				(OR | AND)		#IMPLIED

	MULTI specifies that this dimension should provide multi-select
	support.  OR implies disjunctive multi-select, while AND results
	in conjunctive multi-select.
