<!--

	The DIMENSION_GROUP element specifies that a group of dimensions
	that should be returned together when sent back from the ENE.
	Note that to control the order in which dimensions are returned,
	you should use the DVAL_RANK element to specify a RANK for the root
	dval of the dimension.	That same rank determines how dimensions are
	ordered within a dimension group.  The order of the dimension groups
	is determined by the highest ranked dimension within each group.
