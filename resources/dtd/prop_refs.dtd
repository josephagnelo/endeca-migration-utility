<!--
	The PROP_REF element describes the various attributes of a property
	and also specifies how the values from the property should be
	interpreted and indexed.

	NAME				CDATA			#REQUIRED

	The NAME attribute specifies the name of the property.

	TYPE				(ALPHA
					| INTEGER
					| DOUBLE
					| FIXEDPOINT
					| FILE_PATH
					| ENCODED_FILE_PATH)	#REQUIRED

	The TYPE attribute specifies the property type.  See the Endeca
	documentation for more details on each TYPE.

  The OFFLINE_THRESHOLD attribute controls which strings are stored
  offline.  Strings in the property longer than the threshold will
  be stored offline, those shorter will be stored in the dgraph's
  address space.  The attribute only applies to properties whose
  TYPE is ALPHA.

  The INVERTIBLE attribute determines whether the property model is invertible or not 
  for purposes of range filtering (and perhaps other uses in the future)
