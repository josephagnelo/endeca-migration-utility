<!--
	The SEARCH_INTERFACE is a named collection of dimensions and/or
	properties (both dimensions and properties can co-exist in a
	SEARCH_INTERFACE). The dimensions and/or properties in the group
	are specified by the MEMBER_NAME element which simply contains
	the dimension/property name.

	NOTE: The member dimension/property must be enabled for record
	search, to participate in a SEARCH_INTERFACE.

	If a property or dimension is not included in any SEARCH_INTERFACE
	element, then an implicit SEARCH_INTERFACE element is created
	with the same name as the property or dimension and that single
	property or dimension as its only member.  The value for the
	CROSS_FIELD_RELEVANCE_RANK is set to 0.

	NAME				CDATA			#REQUIRED

	NAME specifies the name of the SEARCH_INTERFACE.

	CROSS_FIELD_RELEVANCE_RANK	CDATA			#IMPLIED

	The CROSS_FIELD_RELEVANCE_RANK attribute specifies the relevance
	rank score for cross-field matches.  The value should be an unsigned
	32-bit integer.  The default value for CROSS_FIELD_RELEVANCE_RANK
	is 0.

	CROSS_FIELD_BOUNDARY		(ALWAYS
					| ON_FAILURE
					| NEVER)		"NEVER"

	The CROSS_FIELD_BOUNDARY attribute specifies when the search
	engine in the ENE should try and match search queries across
	dimension/property boundaries, but within the members of
	the SEARCH_INTERFACE.  If its value is set to ON_FAILURE,
	then the search engine will only try to match queries across
	dimension/property boundaries if it fails to find any match within
	a single dimension/property.  If its value is set to ALWAYS, then
	the engine will always look for matches across dimension/property
	boundaries, in addition to matches within a dimension/property.
	By default, the ENE will not look across boundaries for matches.

	STRICT_PHRASE_MATCH		(TRUE | FALSE)    #IMPLIED

	The STRICT_PHRASE_MATCH attribute specifies that the ENE should
	interpret a query strictly when comparing white space in the query
	with punctuation in the source text.  If set to FALSE, partial
	word tokens connected in the source text by punctuation can be
	matched to a phrase query where the partial tokens are separated
	by spaces instead of matching punctuation.  NOTE: This attribute
	has been deprecated and is ignored by the Navigation Engine.

        The PARTIAL_MATCH element specifies if partial query matches 
        should be supported for the SEARCH_INTERFACE that contains 
        this element. 

        MIN_WORDS_INCLUDED      CDATA                   #IMPLIED 

        The MIN_WORDS_INCLUDED must be an integer value greater than 
        zero.  All results will match at least this many words from 
        the search query.  The default value of this attribute is one. 
        
        MAX_WORDS_OMITTED               CDATA                   #IMPLIED 
        
        The MAX_WORDS_OMITTED must be a non-negative integer value. 
        If the original query had N words, then all results will match 
        at least N - MAX_WORDS_OMITTED words.  If set to zero or left 
        unspecified, any number of words may be omitted (i.e. there 
        is no maximum).  The default value of this attribute is zero 
        (no maximum).

	HITS_THRESHOLD specifies the maximum number of hits for which
	DID_YOU_MEAN suggestions should be generated.  When a very large
	number of hits are returned, computing the DID_YOU_MEAN alternatives
	may be computationally expensive.  The default value is 20.

	HITS_GAIN_THRESHOLD specifies the minimum percentage gain in hits in
	order to consider an alternative valid.  The default value is 10%.
	This value should be a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0.

	SPELLING_SCORE_THRESHOLD specifies the threshold correction score
	for words used by the did-you-mean engine.  The default value is 150.

	MAX_SUGGESTIONS_RETURNED specifies the maximum number of per-word
	spelling corrections to compute for each term in the search query.
	The default value is 3.

	Setting the WORD_BREAK_ANALYSIS attribute to ENABLE causes the
	did-you-mean engine to consider alternate word separation points
	for the query in order to generate suggestions.  The default value
	is ENABLE.

	The MAX_WORDS_TO_REQUEST attribute specifies the maximum number of
	'per-word' spelling corrections to request from the spelling engine
	for each term in the search query.  Its default value is 10.

	MAX_WORDS_TO_USE specifies the maximum number of highest-scored
	per-word spelling suggestions to use from among the available
	suggestions in the spelling engine.  The default value is 10.

	The CROSS_FIELD attribute specifies that cross-property suggestions
	should be allowed and that they should be counted as matches when
	evaluating the frequencies of suggestions.  Normally, suggestions
	must match results in a single property or dimension value.
