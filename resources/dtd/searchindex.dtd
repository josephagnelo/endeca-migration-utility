	The SEARCH_INDEX element controls the construction of the search
	index for record search on properties and dimensions and for
	dimension value search across the set of dimension values (dvals).

	INDEX_BUCKET_SIZE		CDATA			#IMPLIED

    	INDEX_BUCKET_SIZE has been deprecated (>4.6) and will be ignored
    	by DevStudio.
	The INDEX_BUCKET_SIZE attribute specifies the maximum size (in MB)
	for each temporary file used during computation of the text search
	inverted index.  This number should be a valid, positive, numeric
	(double) quantity.  For example, the default value of "128"
	specifies that the maximum temporary file size is 128 megabytes.

	INMEM_INDEX_THRESHOLD		CDATA			#IMPLIED

    	INMEM_INDEX_THRESHOLD has been moved to the RECSEARCH_INDEX and DIMSEARCH_INDEX
    	element (>4.6) and will be moved by DevStudio.
	The INMEM_INDEX_THRESHOLD attribute specifies the maximum text size
	(in MB) for which text indexing will be done entirely in memory.
	If the text size is larger than this threshold, then temporary
	files on disk will be used.

	TEXTSEARCH_SIZE_EST		CDATA			#IMPLIED

    	TEXTSEARCH_SIZE_EST has been deprecated (>4.6) and will be ignored
    	by DevStudio.
	The TEXTSEARCH_SIZE_EST attribute specifies an estimate of the
	text size (in MB) for which text indexing will be done entirely
	in memory.  If the text size is larger than this threshold, then
	temporary files on disk will be used.

	MIN_WORD_OCCURRENCES		CDATA			#IMPLIED

    	MIN_WORD_OCCURRENCES has been moved to the RECSEARCH_INDEX and DIMSEARCH_INDEX
    	element (>4.6) and will be moved by DevStudio.
	The MIN_WORD_OCCURRENCES attribute specifies the minimum number
	of times a word must occur for it to be put into the spelling
	correction dictionary.

	MIN_WORD_LENGTH			CDATA			#IMPLIED

    	MIN_WORD_LENGTH has been moved to the RECSEARCH_INDEX and DIMSEARCH_INDEX
    	element (>4.6) and will be moved by DevStudio.
	The MIN_WORD_LENGTH attribute specifies the minimum number of
	a characters that a word must contain for it to be put into the
	spelling correction dictionary.  By default, all words are put
	into the dictionary.

	MAX_WORD_LENGTH			CDATA			#IMPLIED

    	MAX_WORD_LENGTH has been moved to the RECSEARCH_INDEX and DIMSEARCH_INDEX
    	element (>4.6) and will be moved by DevStudio.
	The MAX_WORD_LENGTH attribute specifies the maximum number of
	a characters that a word may contain for it to be put into the
	spelling correction dictionary.  By default, all words are put
	into the dictionary.

	The existence of the contained elements, WILDCARD_INDEX and
	POSITIONAL_INDEX specifies whether the
	wildcard index, the positional index, and the word affinity index,
	respectively, should be created e.g.

	<SEARCH_INDEX MIN_WORD_LENGTH="2">
		<WILDCARD_INDEX/>
	</SEARCH_INDEX>

	specifies that a WILDCARD index should be generated for the text
	collection that contains this SEARCH_INDEX element.

<!--
	The WILDCARD_INDEX element specifies that a wildcard index should
	be created for the text collection that contains it.  In addition,
	it allows you to control the behavior of the construction of the
	wildcard index itself.

	MAX_NGRAM_LENGTH		CDATA			#IMPLIED

    	MAX_NGRAM_LENGTH has been moved to the RECSEARCH_INDEX and DIMSEARCH_INDEX
    	element (>4.6) and will be moved by DevStudio.
	The MAX_NGRAM_LENGTH attribute specifies the maximum ngram length
	that should be indexed.  All substrings of this length or shorter
	will be indexed.  Thus, if a user does a wildcard search with
	a string that is less than or equal to this length, then exact
	results can returned directly from the index.  If the wildcard
	search includes a substring longer than this length, then the
	results returned from the index will be post-processed so that
	false-positives are eliminated.

	DICTIONARY_WILDCARD		(TRUE | FALSE)		#IMPLIED

    	DICTIONARY_WILDCARD has been moved to the RECSEARCH_INDEX and DIMSEARCH_INDEX
    	element (>4.6) and will be moved by DevStudio.
	The DICTIONARY_WILDCARD attribute specifies whether a wildcard
	index should be generated for the dictionary of words for the text
	collection containing this element.  The default value of this
	attribute is TRUE when the containing element consists of 'offline'
	documents and FALSE otherwise.

	DICTIONARY_MAX_NGRAM_LENGTH	CDATA			#IMPLIED

    	DICTIONARY_MAX_NGRAM_LENGTH has been moved to the RECSEARCH_INDEX and DIMSEARCH_INDEX
    	element (>4.6) and will be moved by DevStudio.
	The DICTIONARY_MAX_NGRAM_LENGTH attribute specifies the maximum
	ngram length that should be indexed in the dictionary wildcard index.

	The POSITIONAL_INDEX element is deprecated.  Positional indexing is 
	now enabled by default.  The existence of this element does not change 
	the behavior of the index, i.e., positional indicies are always generated.

<!ELEMENT POSITIONAL_INDEX EMPTY>

<!--
    	WORDAFFINITY_INDEX has been deprecated (>4.6) and will be ignored
    	by DevStudio.
	The existence of the WORDAFFINITY_INDEX specifies that the word
	affinity index should be created for the text collection containing
	this element.  See the Endeca Documentation for more details on
	the word affinity index.
