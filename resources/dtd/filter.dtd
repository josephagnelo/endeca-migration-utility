FilterLiteral
This entity represents the set of literal values allowed in the filter
expression grammar. Currently we support property values and dimension
values (specified either by id or by full path). A record satisfies a
property value literal iff it includes an assignment matching the literal
exactly (key and value). A record satisfies a dimension value literal iff it
includes a dimension value that is equal to or a descendent of the literal.

<!--
FilterExpr
This entity represents the set of expressions supported by the filter grammar.
Currently we support the basic Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and composition
of filters.

<!--
FILTER
This is the top level containing element. A filter is basically either
a filter expression (currently either AND, OR, NOT, or a reference to
another filter) or a literal (currently either a property+value pair
or a dimension value).

<!--
FILTER_AND, FILTER_OR
These elements represent a conjunction or disjunction (respectively) of
a list of one or more contained filter expressions or literals. We use
a prefix-style notation and allow an arbitrary number of parameters
to cut down on the verbosity of the syntax, wlog.

<!--
FILTER_NOT
This is the standard Boolean unary negation operator, representing the
inverse of a single contained expression or literal.

<!--
FILTER_NAME
This element is the composition operator for filters, allowing the
behavior of one filter to be incorporated by reference into the
definition of another filter.
