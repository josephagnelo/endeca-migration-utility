	INMEM_INDEX_THRESHOLD		CDATA			#IMPLIED

	The INMEM_INDEX_THRESHOLD attribute specifies the maximum text size
	(in MB) for which text indexing will be done entirely in memory.
	If the text size is larger than this threshold, then temporary
	files on disk will be used.

	MAX_NGRAM_LENGTH		CDATA			#IMPLIED

	The MAX_NGRAM_LENGTH attribute specifies the maximum ngram length
	that should be indexed.  All substrings of this length or shorter
	will be indexed.  Thus, if a user does a wildcard search with
	a string that is less than or equal to this length, then exact
	results can returned directly from the index.  If the wildcard
	search includes a substring longer than this length, then the
	results returned from the index will be post-processed so that
	false-positives are eliminated.

	DICTIONARY_WILDCARD		(TRUE | FALSE)		#IMPLIED

	The DICTIONARY_WILDCARD attribute specifies whether a wildcard
	index should be generated for the dictionary of words for the text
	collection containing this element.  The default value of this
	attribute is TRUE when the containing element consists of 'offline'
	documents and FALSE otherwise.

	DICTIONARY_MAX_NGRAM_LENGTH	CDATA			#IMPLIED

	The DICTIONARY_MAX_NGRAM_LENGTH attribute specifies the maximum
	ngram length that should be indexed in the dictionary wildcard index.

	MIN_WORD_OCCURRENCES		CDATA			#IMPLIED

	The MIN_WORD_OCCURRENCES attribute specifies the minimum number
	of times a word must occur for it to be put into the spelling
	correction dictionary.

	MIN_WORD_LENGTH			CDATA			#IMPLIED

	The MIN_WORD_LENGTH attribute specifies the minimum number of
	a characters that a word must contain for it to be put into the
	spelling correction dictionary.  By default, all words are put
	into the dictionary.

	MAX_WORD_LENGTH			CDATA			#IMPLIED

	The MAX_WORD_LENGTH attribute specifies the maximum number of
	a characters that a word may contain for it to be put into the
	spelling correction dictionary.  By default, all words are put
	into the dictionary.
