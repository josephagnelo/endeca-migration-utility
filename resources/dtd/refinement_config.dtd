<!--
	SORT_TYPE			(ALPHA |
					 NUMERIC)		"ALPHA"

	If the SORT_TYPE attribute is set to ALPHA, then the refinement-rank
	refinements from this dimension are returned in alphabetic
	order. If it is set to NUMERIC, then they are sorted numerically.

	SORT_ORDER			(ASC | DESC)		"ASC"

	The SORT_ORDER attribute specifies the order in which refinements
	are returned.  ASC specifies ascending order while DESC specifies
	descending order.

	DVAL_COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD		CDATA			#IMPLIED

	The DVAL_COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD attribute specifies the minimum number of
	refinements that must be the children of a dval from this dimension,
	before the refinements are collapsed into their parent e.g.

	If a dimension named 'A' has a DVAL_COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD of 5 and a
	dval in 'A' contains a collapsible dval with 10 child refinements,
	then the refinement returned will be the collapsible dval, instead
	of the 10 child refinements.

<!--
A CLUSTERS element enables clustering for a given dimension.

NAME is the name of the dimension to enable clustering for.

COHERENCE is a knob to specify the coherence / distinctiveness tradeoff. 
This will be a number between 0 and 10, where 10 leads to the smallest 
clusters, and 0 leads to the largest. Defaults to 5

REC_SAMPLE_SIZE specifies how many records from the current 
navigation state the dgraph should consider when computing 
clusters. The default is 500. Lower numbers will be faster, but 
lead to less accurate results.

MAX_CLUSTERS is the maximum number of clusters to return. Defaults to 6.

MAX_CLUSTER_SIZE is the maximum number of terms in a cluster. Defaults to 8.

MAX_CLUSTER_OVERLAP:
An integer between 0 an 10 which dictates the maximum overlapingness of
clusters that we will return. O disallows any overlap, and 10 allows
full overlap. The default is 5.

MAX_REFINEMENT_PRECISION:
A float between 0 and 1 which specifies the maximum precision for a
refinement which we will consider for clustering. Refinements with
higher precision will be thrown away. Setting this lower prevents
clustering refinements which essentially summarize your query.

<!--
	The DYNAMIC_RANKING element controls how refinements are returned
	from the dimension that contains this element.	If this element is
	included, then the refinement-ranking feature will be activated
	for this dimension.  For more details on refinement-ranking,
	refer to the Endeca Documentation.

	COUNT				CDATA			#IMPLIED

	The COUNT attribute specifies the number of refinements that should
	be returned for this dimension.

	MORE				(TRUE | FALSE)		#REQUIRED

	If the MORE attribute is set to TRUE, then the ENE will compute the
	'More...' refinement for dimensions.  If not, then the ENE will
	only compute the top refinements based on ranking and return those.

	TOP_REFINEMENTS_SORT		(DYNAMIC_RANK |
					DEFAULT)		"DYNAMIC_RANK"

	If TOP_REFINEMENTS_SORT is set to DYNAMIC_RANK, then the refinements
	are returned in refinement-rank order i.e. refinements with
	higher rank are returned before refinements with lower rank.
	If DEFAULT is selected, then refinements will be returned in the
	order specified by the containing REFINEMENTS element.

<!--
	The NUM_RECORDS attribute specifies whether the ENE should
	compute the number of records associated with each refinement.
	This attribute affects the run-time operation of the ENE.  This
	number is returned as a dval property in the ENE query results.
	The default value of this attribute is FALSE.

	The NUM_REFINEMENTS_IN_GROUP attribute specifies whether the ENE
	should return the number of refinements in an open refinement group.
	This attribute affects pre-computation and the run-time operation
	of the ENE.  This number is returned as a dval property in the
	ENE query results.  The default value of this attribute is FALSE.

	The MAX_RECORDS_COUNT specifies the maximum number of records that
	should be returned for the record statistics on a refinement.
	This option is useful, if for example, you wish to know whether
	there are at least 1000 records for a particular refinement option,
	but you don't care if there are any more than that.  If you have
	enabled record statistics in the ENE indexer configuration file,
	reducing this number will improve the performance of the ENE.
	Note that this threshold applies to all dimensions.  By default,
	there is no threshold for the record statistics computation.

	The RECORD_COUNT_DISABLE_THRESHOLD attribute specifies the maximum
	number of records in a result set above which record statistics
	should not be computed for the refinements.  By default, there is
	no threshold for disabling the record statistics computation.

	RETURN_DVAL_STATIC_RANK		(TRUE | FALSE)		#IMPLIED

	The RETURN_DVAL_STATIC_RANK attribute specifies every dval's static
	rank should be returned as a property on the dval, whenever it is
	sent back in ENE computation results.  The default value of this
	attribute is FALSE.

	DVAL_STATIC_RECORD_COUNT	(TRUE | FALSE)		#IMPLIED

	The DVAL_STATIC_RECORD_COUNT attribute specifies whether the number
	of records associated with each dval should be returned as a dval
	property when that dval is returned by the ENE (for example,
	as a refinement).  The number of records associated with each
	dval in this case is statically determined at index time, and is
	the total number of records in the data set that have the dval.
	The default value of this attribute is FALSE.

	REFINEMENT_RANK_SCORE		(TRUE | FALSE)		#IMPLIED

	The REFINEMENT_RANK_SCORE attribute specifies whether the ENE should
	return the rank of each refinement that is from a ranked dimension.
	If set to TRUE, then each refinement's rank will be returned as
	a dval property.  This attribute affects pre-computation and the
	run-time operation of the ENE.	The default value of this attribute
	is FALSE.
